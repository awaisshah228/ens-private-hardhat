# Sample Hardhat Project

Put Achemy node key and wallet private key in env
then compile using
- npx hardhat compile
-  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
